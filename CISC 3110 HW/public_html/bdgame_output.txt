3X: This board game (which is completley automated by the way, so you can't 
really do anything) is a simple race between two players to see who gets 
around the board 3 times first.

Of course, like any board game, there will be spaces that affect the 2 players.
The rules are simple: Roll a six sided dice and move forward that amount of 
spaces. 
The four types of 'action spaces' you can land on include:
-Go Again: The current player rolls again. 
-Lose a Turn: As stated, lose a turn. 
-Swap Places: Switches both player's current postions. Lap progress is not 
affected.
-Move: Moves you forward or backward a certain number of spaces.

Well, if you are ready, press any key and watch the games begin!
