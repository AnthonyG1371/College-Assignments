3X: This board game is a simple race between up to 6 players to see who gets 
around the board 3 times first.

Of course, like any board game, there will be spaces that affect the 2 players.
The rules are simple: Roll a six sided dice and move forward that amount of 
spaces. The spaces are now color coded, with blue being the default color. 
The four types of colored 'action spaces' you can land on include:

Yellow
-Go Again: The current player rolls again. 

Red
-Lose a Turn: As stated, lose a turn. 

Green
-Swap Places: Switches two player's current postions at your choice. Lap 
progress is not affected.

Cyan/Brown
-Move: Moves you forward or backward a certain number of spaces.

NOTE: The order of the players will be shuffled before we start. 

Well, if you are ready, press any key and watch the games begin!
