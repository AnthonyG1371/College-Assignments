5) man cal: This command brings up the manual and options for a calendar function in the Linux terminal.


-----Files and Directories
1) cd: No output required.
2) ls: The only user defined directory at the moment is “public_html”.
3) ls –a: There are 36 hidden directories and files in my home directory. The . directory is the current directory, and the .. is the parent directory.
4) ls –l: The code drwxr—r—means that the directory is readable to everyone, but only the owner of the directory can write (change) and execute it.
5) cal 2014 > year2014:  No response required.
6) more year2014: A 2014 calendar shows up that can be advanced forward by pressing enter.
7) cal 6 2014 > jun.2014; cal 7 2014 > jul.2014; cal 8 2014 > aug.2014: No response required.
8) cat jun.2014 jul.2014 aug.2014 > summer.2014: summer.2014 contains the calendar from June to August 2014.
9) cp summer.2014 SUM.2014: No response required. (In any case, copies the summer.2014 file into the SUM.2014 file)
10) mkdir MyCalendars: No response required.
11) mv *2014 MyCalendars: No response required.
12) From the 3 commands given, cd MyCalendars moves me to the MyCalendars directory. Pwd then shows me the pathname for this directory while ls lists the current files/directories in MyCalendars.
13) rm summer.2014: This command “removed” (deleted) summer.2014. It now won’t show up when using the ls command.
14) mkdir Summer, ls, rmdir Summer: No response required. (Made and deleted a directory)
15) who | sort: Sorts the users on the computer by alphabetical order.
16) cat SUM.2014 | less: Outputs the file to fit on the terminal screen. You can press enter to scroll down until the end.
17) ls *.2014: "aug.2014  jul.2014  jun.2014  SUM.2014". This command prints all files and directories with "2014" in their name.
18) firefox &: Exactly what it says. Opens a web browser. ...Or should if you have firefox.
19) ps :  
      PID TTY          TIME CMD
      18240 pts/1    00:00:00 bash
      18452 pts/1    00:00:00 ps
20) Kills/ends the process in question.
21) grep July *.2014: Displays the files that have the "July 2014" in them.
      jul.2014:      July 2014     
      SUM.2014:      July 2014
